# first_solidity

It's the first token that I have made using solidity. It is just a simple representation of how a contract works,and how minting and burning works.

# Description

This is a simple program made using solidity a programming language mostly used for making smart contracts on Ethereum bloackchain.
which includes two functions representing the working of minting and burning of coins on a blockchain network. It also shows the implementation of smart contracts in solidity.

# Executing the program 
```javascript


```
To implement the program one needs an IDE which supports solidity, and then anyone can use the code to implement it up there. 
I have used an online platform/editor named remix and one can use it as well on the site: [](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
